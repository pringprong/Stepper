NEW: Sneak preview of interface for the upcoming v2.0
This program rewrites Stepmania .ssc and .sm stepfiles and create 5 new Dance Single and 5 Pump Single stepfiles according to the user's specifications.
Users are encouraged to copy their Stepmania songs to a new song group folder before clicking Overwrite stepfiles.
Stepper can be used to convert Keyboard, Pad, and Pump It Up stepfiles to Pad and Pump.
Stepper is written in C#.NET and compiled for .NET 4.0. It has been tested on Windows 7 and Windows XP.
Please download Stepper.exe (or download the source code and compile it yourself) and try it out.
